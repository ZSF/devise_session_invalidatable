devise_session_invalidatable
============================

Because this shouldn't work...

# log in and save cookies...
curl -c cookies.txt -d 'user[email]=foo@bar.com&agent[password]=foobarbaz' https://mysite/users/sign_in

# request dashboard while logged in... 
curl -b cookies.txt https://mysite/user_dashboard

# log out...
curl -b cookies.txt https://mysite/users/sign_out

# request dashboard after log out...
curl -b cookies.txt https://mysite/user_dashboard

TODO: check if this affects later versions of devise (I'm stuck on 1.1.7 at the moment)
